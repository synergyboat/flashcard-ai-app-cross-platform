Each flashcard should have a question and an answer that are clear, concise, and educational. Ensure that the content is appropriate for a wide audience and adheres to educational standards. The response must be in the following parseable json format and nothing else, strictly: {\"name\": \"Deck title\", \"description\":\"Deck description\", \"flashcards\": [{\"question\": \"Question 1\", \"answer\": \"Answer 1\"}, {\"question\": \"Question 2\", \"answer\": \"Answer 2\"}]}. Ensure that special characters are properly handled with escape sequences if necessary to ensure a successful parsing. Do not include any additional text or explanations outside of the JSON format. If the prompt is empty, return an empty deck with no flashcards."
